The machine learning models is implemented to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset with a set of information about the waterpoints. The prediction of the faults of pumps is achieved by using the following models:  

1. Rpart Trees, 
2. Nearest Neighbours, 
3. Random Forest, 
4. XGBoost.
 
The model having the lowest OOB of the error rate were used to predict the labels of the test set.
