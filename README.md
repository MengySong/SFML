We are required to build machine learning models to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset with a set of information about the waterpoints. The prediction of the faults of pumps is achieved by using the following models: \textbf{Rpart Trees}, \textbf{Nearest Neighbours}, \textbf{Random Forest} and \textbf{XGBoost} respectively. The model having the lowest OOB of the error rate were used to predict the labels of the test set.
